## Fuzzy-Anki (spect88's fork)

This is a fork of Ahmed Fasih's
[Fuzzy-Anki browser](https://github.com/fasiha/fuzzy-anki).

I basically needed an app with simple UI to browse and search through
my custom Anki deck and Ahmed's Fuzzy-Anki was a good starting point.
That said, my goals are slightly different, so the functionality in this
fork will go in a different direction.

Goals:
* Anki card browser with filtering
* Simple UI

Non-goals:
* Anki review logs analysis - please use the original
  [Fuzzy-Anki](https://github.com/fasiha/fuzzy-anki) if you need this
* Support for every possible Anki card format - I'll focus on my own
  use case which is fairly trivial: simple Front/Back text-only cards
